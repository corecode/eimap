;;; WHAT IS THIS?

; eimap is an experiment to approach IMAP processing from a new angle.
;
; the protocol parser and generator are both formally generated from
; grammars.
;
; instead of using a request-reply approach (which does not work well
; with IMAP), eimap uses a streaming data model:
;
; data from the server is automatically parsed into usable lisp data
; structures and directly handed to a handler for the incoming data
; (not shown in the sample code below).
;
; if the application requires other data that has not been streamed in
; yet, it can request the server to send this data, using the
; `eimap-request' method (see example below).


;;; USAGE TEASER

(add-to-list 'load-path default-directory)

(require 'eimap)

(eimap
 "0x2c.org" :user "2"
 ;; default is IMAP+STARTTLS.
 ;; pass :port "imaps" for SSL connection to port 993
)

;; check out (switch-to-buffer-other-window "*Messages*")
;; that's where all the parsed data arrived
